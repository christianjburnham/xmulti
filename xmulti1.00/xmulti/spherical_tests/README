SPHERICAL HARMONIC TESTS

Christian J. Burnham, University College Dublin 2019

Three small codes which do the following

i) Populate the components of two rank n Cartesian tensors, a and b, with random numbers.

ii) Detrace each tensor. This is done essentially by converting the cartesians to 
spherical harmonics, and then converting then back into cartesians.

iii) Detrace each tensor again, which should leave the tensor 
unchanged, hence showing that the detracing operator is a projection operator.

iv) Check that the traces of the detraced tensor are zero, where the 
traces are a rank n - 2 tensor.

v) Calculate the inner product: <a,b> (where a and be are zero trace), 
in both Cartesians and spherical harmonics, to show that they give the 
same results.

The codes are intentionally short and easy to follow. Studying them 
will give a good understanding of how to convert between 
cartesians and spherical harmonics.

The subroutines convert_xx_to_cartesian and 
convert_xx_to_spherical, where xx = quad/oct/hex 
are based on the tables in

A new relatively simple approach to the multipole interactions in either 
spherical harmonics or Cartesians, suitable for implementation into Ewald sums
