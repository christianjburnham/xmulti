SUPERCELL.F
---------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION

This is an auxillary code which is useful to view the best crystal structure minima found by XMULTI.F. It simply replicates the unit cell coordinate in all 3 directions, so that the 
periodic structure of the crystal is made more apparent.

COMPILATION

gfortran -O3 -ffree-form -ffast-math supercell.f -o supercell

Run code with: ./supercell

SUPERCELL INPUT FILES:

Requires MONTE_MIN.XYZ, which is output from basin-hopping run of XMULTI.F, and which contains the coordinates of the best minima found so far.

SUPERCELL OUTPUT FILES:

SUPER.XYZ: A VMD viewable file, which contains the replicated XYZ coordinates of the crystal structure minima found by XMULTI.F.

MAKESTRUCT.F
---------------------------------------------------
Generates random initial input file

COMPILATION

gfortran -O3 -ffree-form -ffast-math makestruct.f -o makestruct

MAKESTRUCT INPUT FILES: 

MAKESTRUCT.CONTROL
      control file for makestruct.f

MAKESTRUCT.CONTROL KEYWORDS:

PERIODIC(keyword)
    sets periodicity of cell to be on. (Default: periodic is off.)
    To run a system without periodicity, just delete this line.
CVEC (keyword), [{CX,CY,CZ}(real)] 
  sets the length of the orthorhombic cell-vectors
RMIN(keyword), [rmin]
  sets the minimum center of mass distance between two molecules in the structure, with rmin in Angstroms.
MOLNAME [nmol]
  will generate the structure for nmol molecules with name MOLNAME. MOLNAME should correspond to a molecule 
  in GEOMETRY_FILE and MODEL_FILE.

MAKESTRUCT OUTPUT FILES: 

MAKESTRUCT 
prints structure to screen. To generate an input file, try ./makestruct > input.dat
